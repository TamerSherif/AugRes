# AugRes

A desk reservation system for the Everyday Employee

## Description

Desk hoteling is the concept of having bookable desks at various work locations rather than assigning the workspaces to specific individuals. It allows employees the flexibility to work in different offices and out of office, without wasting valuable company real estate. According to Teem.com, 78% of companies allow their employees to work from home when possible (Teem.com, 2018). Therefore, to optimize efficiencies, employees’ work stations are not reserved when they are not at the office. 

Online booking systems created for workspace reservation can be difficult to use, resulting in people picking work stations that appear available when they enter the office, without consulting the system. This leads to a disconnect between what is booked in the reservation system, and spaces that are actually being used in the office.

Our hackathon team has come up with a solution that combines employee habits with secure company booking systems. Our product is an Augmented Reality mobile application that helps users book work stations and meeting rooms at the office as well as navigate to them.

Augmented Reservation is hosted on the IBM Cloud and uses Apple AR Kit to facilitate the everyday task of booking a work station. The key stakeholders are employees and senior management, as the application will ensure efficient utilization of workspace.

Our product can be employed by any company that has already implemented desk hoteling in their offices, and can encourage others to implement a similar efficient system. We have created a low-cost application that can be connected to any company’s current booking system. However, this product can also be scaled to other enterprise models to aid with space navigation. We see our product being expanded for use in movie theatres, convention centers, and outdoor markets.
